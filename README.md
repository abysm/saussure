# Saussure

A "hyper" blog application. A mini-CMS. An application for working with small units
of information networked with various metadata - denotations and connotations of terms,
examples, exigeses, icons and symbols, synonyms, antonyms, etc. The goal is to allow
complex topics to be exposed in a non-linear manner and to allow users to organize
the information along various "axes." These axes may be vectors, trees, subnetworks, etc.

For example, one way to organize the information might be chronologically. Another might be
geographically. Users may wish to generate their own "views" of the information.

The idea is to go beyond the chronological/tagged/indexed nature of current "blogs" to 
provide:

* a small-scale but semantically-rich environment
* an interface that makes it  easy for readers to find comfortable and rewarding paths through the information
* an editing interface that makes it simple and straightforward for content creators to link information together
